A simple adaptation of the "[No Indium?](https://github.com/Luligabi1/NoIndium)" mod designed to deter players from using OptiFine with modern-day mods and modpacks.

## Why?

In the past, OptiFine was the go-to solution for boosting client performance and could often be used just fine even on modded clients. However, due its closed-source nature and increasingly invasive approach to patching the game, it has become nigh-infeasible to use in the present day in combination with most big-name mods.

In spite of this, many users will still habitually fall back onto OptiFine as their "performance boost" mod of choice, often not realising that alternatives exist which are not as prone to breaking with other mods. While not always necessarily the fault of the user, this still tends to be a major source of headache for the average modder due to the continued large volume of reports and complaints that neglect to mention the use of OptiFine to begin with.

OptiFugg aims to provide more direct encouragement to the user to seek alternatives which may be of greater benefit to them and ditch OptiFine in the modern day once and for all. This can be either mildly cautionary or more forceful; OptiFugg comes with a simple configuration file which determines both whether the warning screen can be bypassed and ignored in future, or whether to go down the nuclear route altogether and crash the user's client on startup if they attempt to add OptiFine to their installation.
